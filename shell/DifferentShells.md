I've always thought that all the shell scripts follow the same rules until I read the document of zsh.

There are different kinds of shells and their scripts are different from each other.

* zsh: I am using zsh now
* Korn shell(ksh): similar to zsh. Earlier than zsh
* sh(Bourne shell): Grandfather of all UNIX shells
* bash(Bourne-Again Shell): Maybe most widely used shell. sh in some free UNIX-like systems is really bash.
* POSIX shell: Like the Korn shell
* C-Shell(csh): Its syntax looks more like the C programming language.
